            I honestly don't know what you were expecting here. I'm just a high school student who likes robots and bad code. If it isn't USB-C, I don't want it. The FIRST Tech Challenge is pretty cool, and I'm glad to be a team member and event volunteer.

            Some days I write code, other days I do CAD, and when I'm not doing either of those, I'm probably locked in academic hell. If you want to contact me, don't. I'm not that interesting.
