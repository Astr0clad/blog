    Robots are funny, so is bad code. I like both robots and bad code. FTC 21579 Captain and Software Lead (somehow). Depending on who you ask, I can sorta CAD too. The best robots are combat robots, they like to explode. I have one named Discount Destroyer, maybe there are posts about that bot somewhere.
